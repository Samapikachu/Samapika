  "RecipeName": "Homemade Quick Puff Pastry Sheet Recipe | Perfect For Puffs, Tarts & Pies.",
  "Ingredients": "315 grams All Purpose Flour (Maida),5 grams Salt,220 grams Butter (unsalted) - chilled and chopped into 3\/4 inch pieces,120 ml Chilled water",
  "Calories": 200,
  "Carbon Footprint Amt": "moderate",
  "Cuisine": "Continental",
  "Course": "Vegetarian",
  "Diet": "Diabetic Friendly",
  "Instructions": "To begin making the Quick Puff Pastry Recipe Sheet for making puffs, measure all the ingredients and keep them ready.Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and give a quick stir to combine it. Add the large cubes of butter into the flour mixture.Ensure each piece of butter is coated fully into flour. When it is coated in flour it will be less likely to melt and also less likely to melt out of the dough later when we roll to make the sheets.This process of covering the butter with flour is called lamination of the butter with flour. If it is not laminated well, the butter will melt out of the dough and you will end up with a puff that is not flaky. Next, squish up the cubes of butter coated with flour by pressing between your fingers.  Like shown in the image below.Once all the pieces are squished, just toss them in flour once again. You need to ensure all the butter pieces are well coated with flour.Make a well in the center and add little ice water at a time. Starting with 1\/3 cup and then adding more if required a tablespoon at a time. Because every single brand of flour absorbs moisture differently, we need to ensure we add that water little at a time. To mix the water in, toss the flour into the water and it helps the water get incorporated to form the dough without kneading. Do not knead the dough, as it can activate too much gluten.When it gets to a stage where the puff pastry dough forms large clumps, you can knead a little to understand how much more moisture is needed to bring the dough together without breaking those butter shingles. Add a few tablespoons of water if needed again to bring the dry flour together to form the dough. It is important to get the dough to the right hydration level. If it becomes too wet, then the dough will become sticky and might not be the best thing for puff pastry. Gently press and bring the flour together to form a dough without kneading. It is important to work as quickly as possible. If you take too long and knead too long the heat from your hands will melt the butter and make it sticky. We need to ensure that the butter is still in big pieces in the dough after bringing it together.The dough will look rough and not smooth and you will be able to see the big chunks of butter and will not look totally smooth.Divide the dough in two halves and shape each piece into an almost square disk.Wrap each disc of dough in a plastic\/ cling film wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. Based on the warmth and the humidity of the region, a minimum one hour will allow the dough to rest before we begin the folds to make the puff pastry sheet.After one hour, remove the dough from the refrigerator.Dust the working surface with very little flour. Open one of the discs while the other is still in refrigeration. First RoundRoll out the dough into a rough rectangle shape to about 1\/2 inch thickness. The dough will be tough, so use a little muscle to roll it out.If you feel the dough is sticky with butter, sprinkle a little bit of flour in the area where the butter feels sticky.  Ensure you dust off any excess flour.Once you have rolled it into a 1\/2 inch thick rectangle, fold the dough into half and then fold the half into a quarter again. This is the first fold. We will proceed to make the 2nd fold in the same round.Dust a little flour if required and roll into a 1\/2 inch rectangle again and then do the folds (first into half and then again fold the half into a quarter).Wrap this dough the same cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour until the dough is firm.Second RoundAfter an hour, repeat the process mentioned in the first round again. Once you are done with at least 3 to 4 rounds of rolling, folding and chilling process, the puff pastry dough is ready. You need to ensure you refrigerate the puff pastry dough for at least 6 to 8 hours before you are ready to use it to make puffs, tarts and more. These puff pastry sheets can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 to 4 months. When you are ready to use them, thaw for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature and begin using it for the recipes. "

Give it a mix. In a separate bowl, add the lemon juice to the cold water and keep aside.Now, add the frozen grated butter to the flour and mix it quickly with the help of a fork. Do not use your hands, otherwise butter will start melting.Start adding the cold water, a tablespoon at a time, and keep mixing with the fork. Then bring it all together with your hands. You will have a big rough ball of dough. Put the dough on a flat surface and lightly pat it with your hand. Then wrap it in a cling film and keep it in fridge to rest for a minimum of 1 hour. You can prepare this dough in advance also.You can keep it in the fridge for up to 3 days and up to 2 months in the freezer. The next step is to make the filling. In a non- stick pan, heat a teaspoon of oil and then add chopped mushrooms, zucchini, and a teaspoon of salt.Sauté it for about 5-10 minutes or until the water released from the vegetables dries up. Take the vegetables from the pan, pu it in a bowl and keep aside.Now, in the same pan, add butter and as soon the butter heats up, add garlic and onion. When the onion becomes golden brown, add the sautéed mushrooms and zucchini. Next, add salt and thyme, and cook for a minute. Remove from heat and keep aside to cool down.The final step is to prepare the puffs. To begin with, put your oven on preheat at 200°C and line your baking tray with parchment paper.Next, add egg and milk in a bowl and lightly beat it to prepare the egg wash. If you don’t want to use egg, then you can use only milk.Now, take out the prepared dough from the fridge and pat it down on a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll it out to the thickness of a chapati\/roti.You can use dry flour whenever the dough starts sticking to the surface. For easier handling, you can take half of the prepared dough at a time as it will be easier to roll out.Using a round utensil, cut out the round shapes from the rolled out dough. I used a 5-inch bowl to cut and it made around 13-14 puffs.Now, on half portion of the cut out sheets, first put some grated cheese. Then spread the cooled prepared filling on top of the cheese. Make small cuts on the other half and then fold it over to close the puff.Using a fork, press the edges of the puffs to seal them properly. Now, lightly brush the puffs with egg wash\/milk wash and sprinkle sesame seeds on top.Put the prepared puffs on the baking tray and bake at 180°C for about 25 minutes or until the puffs become golden brown. Serve Mushrooms & Zucchini Puffs Recipe along with some Tomato Ketchup and hot cup of Masala Tea as an evening snack or at your tea or Kitty parties."

  "Instructions": "To begin making the Mangalorean Manoli Curry Recipe; we will first steam cook the Manoli. You can use a pressure cooker or a steamer to cook it. Precooking the Manoli (Indian Gherkins) makes the cooking process faster and more nutritious too.I like to use a pressure cooker for steaming the vegetables. To do this, place the cut Manoli (Indian Gherkins) along with a pinch of salt and 2 tablespoons of water into the pressure cooker.Cover the pan, place the weight on and allow the vegetable to cook in the pressure cooker until you hear two whistles.  After a whistle, turn off the heat and you can place the pressure cooker under running water to release the pressure immediately. Releasing the pressure immediately, helps retain the fresh green color of the Gherkins and also gives it a perfectly cooked texture.Click here to watch the video of how to cook vegetables in a pressure cooker.Our next step is to make the Manoli Curry Masala. In a small pan; roast the dry red chillies, fenugreek, coriander, cumin and black pepper until you can smell the roasted aromas. Add these to a small blender jar, along with the coconut, tamarind and turmeric powder.Grind the spices adding very little water to make a smooth curry paste. The Manoli curry paste is now ready. Keep aside.In the next step; heat a teaspoon of oil in a pan; add the chopped onions, and saute for a couple of minutes until the onions are soft and tender. Add the curry paste and saute for a couple of more minutes.Stir in the steamed gherkins, salt and add about 1-1\/2 to 2 cups of water. You essentially want a thick gravy for the Manoli Curry; hence add water accordingly. Give all the ingredients a good stir. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste. Give the mixture a quick boil only when you are ready to serve. Serve the Mangalorean Manoli Curry Recipe along with Whole Wheat Lachha Paratha and Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita for an everyday meal."

  "Instructions": "To begin making the Rich Chocolate Cheesecake recipe, first preheat the oven to 180 C. Keep all the ingredients ready, so you can proceed to make the cake as explained below.First we will make the biscuit base for the cheesecake.In the food processor, crush the biscuits until it forms crumbs. Add in the butter to the biscuits and blend to combined.Pour the biscuit butter mixture onto the springform pan and press it down evenly. Refrigerate the crust until we make the cheesecake batter.Next we will make the chocolate sauce for the cheesecake using the double boiler method.Place the chocolate in a saucepan and add in the 50 grams of butter. Place the saucepan over another bowl, that has water boiling underneath. This is called the double boiler method. Melt the chocolate over the simmering water until the chocolate is smooth and creamy. Remove from the heat and keep aside to cool.Once the chocolate cools, stir in the cocoa powder and keep aside.If you stir the cocoa when the sauce is hot, the mixture will thicken too quickly and it will become lumpy.Our next step is to make the cheesecake batter.For this place the cream cheese, caster sugar in a large bowl or the bowl of the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and beat until the cream cheese is fluffy. Gradually add in one egg at a time and beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy.Next beat in the chocolate cocoa sauce into the cheesecake batter. Finally add in the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract and beat until just combined. Pour the chocolate cheesecake batter onto the biscuit base. Wrap the outside of the springform pan with a foil. We do this so that water does not get into the cheesecake while we are baking. Place a roasting tin of the oven, filled with quarter way through with hot water and place it in the middle rack of the oven. This will help the cake steam as well as bake and retain the moisture needed for the cheesecake.Place the springform cake pan on this roasting tin and bake the Chocolate Cheesecake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes. The cake will jiggle a little bit when you remove from the oven. This is the consistency we want for the cake. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and allow it to cool completely. Refrigerate for at least 12 hours before you are ready to serve.To serve the Rich Chocolate Cheesecake , remove the side of the springform pan and cut into wedges of desired size. Top the cheesecake with tart fruits like raspberries or a strawberry compote. Serve this Rich Chocolate Cheesecake as a dessert after a meal of Lemon Coriander Soup Recipe and Schezwan Noodle Sandwich Recipe."

The batter should be such that it can coat the back of a spoon.Keep the rice flour and sesame seeds ready.If you are using mini bananas (almost a large finger size), then slice it lengthwise into half. If you are using a large banana, then cut it into half, then slice it half lengthwise. Keep it aside.Next grease a 8 x 8 inch foil or a butter paper with oil and dust it with flour. This is so that when we air fry the batter dipped bananas, they don’t stick to the foil or the paper.Fit the foil or the butter paper pinching the ends so as to leave a little gap for air circulation.Dip banana slices into the wet batter, then roll the wet batter coated banana slices into the dry rice flour and then onto the sesame seeds. I like adding sesame seeds to the top as it adds a crunchiness to the air fried bananas.Place the batter dipped bananas into the greased foil or butter paper. Air fry the bananas at 200C for about 10 to 15 minutes, flipping half way through so it gets fried evenly all around.Once ready, serve the Thai Crispy Fried Bananas as an tea time snack or even as a dessert served along with vanilla ice cream."

Set aside.Mix flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a depression in the center, pour in the eggs, melted butter and yeast mixture. Knead into smooth dough by adding additional water until pliable and soft.Transfer the dough to a clean surface, dust little flour and knead for about 20 minutes until the dough is smooth and shiny.Make a ball, and transfer to the same bowl in which you started, grease the bowl and the dough with olive oil.Cover the dough with a damp cloth and leave it to prove for an hour or until the size of the dough is doubled in volume.After the dough has risen to double the volume, Punch the dough and knead it again. Divide the dough into 4 portions.Take one of the portions and roll it into a circle that is 2mm thick like chapati. I used a plate to cut the round shape from the dough, so all my 4 portions are equal in size.Grease the baking tray with olive oil and place the rolled dough on the baking tray. Spread pizza sauce on top of the rolled dough, leaving the edges.Next take the second portion of the dough and roll it to the same size. Lift the roll carefully and place it on top of the first layer. Spread pizza sauce on top leaving the edges, like you did for the first layer.Repeat step the same steps for two more layers. Do not spread the pizza sauce on top of the 4th and final layer.Place a very small bowl or the mouth of a glass at the center of the layers. Using a sharp knife, slit the layers of dough sheets together into 4 (in a plus shape but leaving the center intact). Next cut in between the 4 portions and make 8 divisions(in a plus shape but leaving the center intact). Finally cut in between the 8 portions making 16 wedges throughout.Like a braid, take two adjacent wedges and place each wedge on the opposite side and twist further till centre and form the petal in the centre. Similarly braid every 2 adjacent wedges by twisting and making a flower formation at the end of the work. Seal the edges when you are at the end of every braid twist.Cover the flower with damp cloth and let it prove for another 30 minutes.

  "Instructions": "To begin making the Strawberry & Chocolate Rolls Recipe With Vanilla Glaze, we have to first make the strawberry filling for the roll. For the strawberry filling:In a pan, add the chopped strawberries and cook over medium-heat. Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring constantly, or until the strawberries become soft and mushy, and have released their juices.Add in the sugar and cornstarch stir vigorously to avoid forming lumps.  Continue to cook - and stir - for another 1-2 minutes. Remove pan from heat when the mixture thickens up and transfer the filling into a small bowl. Set aside.*To make the dough:In a pan, add the milk and heat on low flame for 1 minute until it becomes lukewarm. Turn off the flame. Now add a pinch of sugar and yeast to the lukewarm milk and stir it for few seconds. Keep aside undisturbed for 10 minutes or until froth appears on top of the milk. While adding the yeast to the milk, ensure that your milk is lukewarm and not hot, because if it is hot then chances are that your yeast will die.In a separate bowl, add sugar, egg, salt, melted butter, and the milk-yeast mixture. Whisk until all ingredients are well combined.Start adding the flour, 1\/3rd at a time, and gently mix it with a spatula. Mix well, until a thick, sticky dough forms and all the flour is incorporated.Dump the dough on a well-floured surface and knead just until the dough is no longer sticky and forms a ball.This will take about 10-15 minutes.Alternatively you can even knead the dough in a food processor .Place the dough into a greased bowl. Put little bit oil on top of the dough, cover the bowl with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and allow the dough to rise at a warm place for at least an hour or until doubled in size.*To make the rolls:Once the dough has risen, put it on a lightly floured surface and gently squish the dough ball with your hands to make a rectangular shape. Now using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough while maintaining the rectangular shape. Roll it to a size of about 14 X 6\" rectangle.Now spread the cooled strawberry filling on the rolled out dough leaving about 1\/2 inch border. On top of the strawberry filling, spread the grated chocolate.Start making the roll by rolling from the long side. (You have to roll length wise). Now using a serrated knife, cut out about 8 rolls and place them in a greased baking pan.Cover the pan with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and place it at a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes or until the rolls have doubled up in size.Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven at 180°C for about 25 minutes or until they become golden brown.Once your rolls are baked, remove them from the baking pan while they are still warm. Otherwise they will stick to the bottom due to sticky strawberry and chocolate filling.*For the glaze:In a bowl, add icing sugar, milk, and vanilla essence.Mix well using a whisk or a spoon until you get a smooth and lump free glaze.Drizzle the glaze over warm rollsServe this Strawberry & Chocolate Rolls With Vanilla Glaze as a Tea Time Cake along with a cup of Golden Detox Tea or even Qahwa - Arabic Coffee if you fancy it.\n"

Now add a pinch of sugar and yeast to the lukewarm milk and stir it for few seconds. Keep aside undisturbed for 10 minutes or until froth appears on top of the milk. While adding the yeast to the milk, ensure that your milk is lukewarm and not hot, because if it is hot then chances are that your yeast will die.In a separate bowl, add sugar, egg, salt, melted butter, and the milk-yeast mixture. Whisk until all ingredients are well combined.Start adding the flour, 1\/3rd at a time, and gently mix it with a spatula. Mix well, until a thick, sticky dough forms and all the flour is incorporated.Dump the dough on a well-floured surface and knead just until the dough is no longer sticky and forms a ball.This will take about 10-15 minutes.Alternatively you can even knead the dough in a food processor .Place the dough into a greased bowl. Put little bit oil on top of the dough, cover the bowl with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and allow the dough to rise at a warm place for at least an hour or until doubled in size.*To make the rolls:Once the dough has risen, put it on a lightly floured surface and gently squish the dough ball with your hands to make a rectangular shape. Now using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough while maintaining the rectangular shape. Roll it to a size of about 14 X 6\" rectangle.Now spread the cooled strawberry filling on the rolled out dough leaving about 1\/2 inch border. On top of the strawberry filling, spread the grated chocolate.Start making the roll by rolling from the long side. (You have to roll length wise). Now using a serrated knife, cut out about 8 rolls and place them in a greased baking pan.Cover the pan with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and place it at a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes or until the rolls have doubled up in size.Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven at 180°C for about 25 minutes or until they become golden brown.Once your rolls are baked, remove them from the baking pan while they are still warm. Otherwise they will stick to the bottom due to sticky strawberry and chocolate filling.*For the glaze:In a bowl, add icing sugar, milk, and vanilla essence.Mix well using a whisk or a spoon until you get a smooth and lump free glaze.Drizzle the glaze over warm rollsServe this Strawberry & Chocolate Rolls With Vanilla Glaze as a Tea Time Cake along with a cup of Golden Detox Tea or even Qahwa - Arabic Coffee if you fancy it.\n"

Soak them for a minimum of 6 hours or leave it overnight. Wash the soak the poha in a bowl of water for 20 minutes before grinding the idli batter.Transfer the urad dal and methi seeds into a mixer-jar and grind into a smooth paste using a little water. Transfer this into a mixing bowl in which the batter will be mixed and set aside. Next transfer the horse gram into a mixer-jar and grind into a smooth paste using a little water. Add this to the bowl having the ground urad dal. Likewise grind the millets along with the poha and transfer it to the bowl in which the batter is going to be mixed. Bring all the ground mixtures together in a bowl and mix thoroughly to get a uniform batter. Rest and ferment for 8-10 hours in a warm place. Once the batter is fermented, add salt and water if required to adjust the consistency. We need a batter of dropping  consistency to make the idlis.Once you have the fermented  Idli batter, grease the Idli Steamer Plates with a little oil. Pour spoonfuls of the idli batter into these moulds.Do make sure you fill the idli batter only half way through as they will rise up to the top when steamed. Once all the plates are filled, place the filled idli racks one above the other making sure the holes are facing the filled portion.Prepare the idli steamer with a little water in the bottom. Place the filled idli racks in the steamer. Place the steamer on high heat and steam the idli’s for 10 minutes.After 10 minutes of steaming, turn off the heat. Open the steamer and insert a knife or a pick to test whether the idli's are cooked. If nothing sticks then the idlis are perfectly steamed.Now you can remove the idli from the steamer. Have a small bowl filled with water. Dip a spoon in the water and then scoop the idli out starting from the edges. Dipping the spoon in water helps in the easy removal of idli from the plates.Pair Horsegram And Foxtail Millet Idli with Mysore Chutney and Keerai Sambar for a delicious breakfast.\n"
