Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.Set the millet phulka dough aside to rest covered for 15 minutes. Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions.Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat. Roll the portions of phulka (roti) dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.Take a portion of the Millet phulka dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Cook the millet phulka as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Gas StovePlace rolled dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled dough to the other side on the skillet.After a few seconds turn the flame to high; using tongs take the rolled Millet phulka off the skillet and place it directly on the flame. It should balloon into a spherical shape and puff up.Remove the Millet phulka from heat, place it on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled Millet phulka dough and keep stacking them one over the other.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Electric StoveThis process can be used if you are using a gas stove as well.Preheat an iron skillet.

At this point flip the rolled Millet phulka dough to the other side on the skillet.Flip over again and cook the first side pressing lightly with a napkin. The rolled out phulka dough should begin to start puffing out.Flip and cook the other side for a few more seconds.Remove from the heat, place the Millet phulka on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up. Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled dough and keep stacking them the phulka one over the other.Serve the Mixed Millet Phulka Recipe with Spinach Paneer Kofta Curry and Dangar Pachadi With Grated Carrots to create complete healthy meal.TipMaking the rolled out phulka dough puff into a balloon comes with practice. So give yourself time if you are new to bread making.Even if yours does not puff the first time or the times after, the rotis that you have made are cooked and are edible, so you could consume them with your choice of vegetables.Using thinner rolling pins is the key, as you want to be gentle with the dough.The heavy big ones will make you press harder which might just make it tear. Its well worth investing in a thinner rolling pin and tongs to hold the bread which is available in most Indian stores around the world.Tossing the phulka dough in flour as you roll is another helper that will make the rolling out the dough easier."

Set aside 4 tablespoons of chopped nuts for decoration.Put the remainder in a bowl and combine it with 1/3 cup of sugar, cinnamon and cloves and mix well.Method to assemble and bake the baklavaHeat the oven to 170 C. Lay a dish towel on a work surface and sprinkle it lightly with water. Thaw the phyllo dough package according the manufacturers instructions.Unroll the sheets on the towel and then cover it with a second damp dish towel. When unrolling them I encountered several cracks and cuts in the sheets.Do not panic. They are easily repairable and do not make any difference in the dessert.Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Brush a baking pan with melted butter. Take a sheet of phyllo dough and carefully spread it in the pan, folding the sheet in such a way that it fits the pan.Brush the layered sheet with butter and gently press it into the sides and corners of the pan.Lay another sheet on top and brush with butter. Do the same with the third of the sheets. Once 1/3rd of the sheets have been used, scatter half the nut filling over the layers.Layer another third of the sheets in the pan, buttering each one and pressing into the corners and sides. Then sprinkle the remaining half of the nut mixture evenly.Layer the last third of the sheets, buttering them and pressing them the same way as we did with the previous layers. Brush the top most layer thoroughly with butter and pour any remainder of butter on the top (I ignored the last step. I did not pour the remaining butter. I just liberally brushed the top layer and left it at that).So essentially, after every 3 sheets there is a nut layer for the baklava recipe.With a small knife, cut diagonal lines around 1/2-inch deep to mark out the shape. Do not press down too much when cutting.Place the tray in the oven and bake for around 1 hr 15 minutes (It took me exactly 1 hr) until golden brown in color.Method to make the honey syrupCombine the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat until dissolved, stirring occasionally. Pour in the honey and stir to combine.Boil without stirring until the syrup reaches a soft ball consistency (239F on a candy thermometer). This process takes about 30  minutes.To test the consistency without the thermometer, take the pan off the heat and dip a teaspoon in the syrup. Let it cool down for few seconds and then drop it in a small cup with water.Once dropped into the water, it should form a mushy ball.Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool down to lukewarm temperature. Now add the juice from a lemon and the orange flower water or the vanilla extract.Method to finish the baklava recipeRemove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava.Pouring the syrup over the hot pastries enables better absorption.With the chefs knife cut along the marked lines almost to the bottom of the pan. Let the pastries cool.Cut through the marked lines completely and carefully lift the pastries with a spatula and arrange them on a plate.Sprinkle the top with the reserved nuts and serve the Baklava for your parties and special occasions.

Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked and has a rich white colour. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosas the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosas away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other.

It is important to have a smooth surface and the ideal is granite counter top. Clean the counter top thoroughly as you will be spreading the cooked gram flour mixture. If you don't have a granite counter top, then you can use a flat plate or a smooth cookie sheet big enough to spread the mixture. If you do it on plates, or cookie sheets, you will probably have to spread the mixture in multiple rounds. The number of these plates you need will depend on how thin you spread the mixture. My estimate is about 3-4 plates of 12 inch diameter. Also if you use plates or cookie sheets, spread them on the back side.Transfer the khandvi batter into a non-stick pan and heat on low to medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent lump formation. Continue stirring on low heat, till the mixture thickens for 15 minutes.The mixture will begin to attain a shine. Once you notice the Khandvi batter has a shine to it and has thickened, turn off the heat. Keep the mixture covered, so it remains hot while you proceed to the steps below, as it will not spread when it cools down.Spread the hot mixture on the prepared surface as thinly as possible, with a flat spatula. When you have finished spreading the batter, allow it to cool a little and settle down about three minutes and not less. Repeat this process and continue to spread the entire mixture, before it cools down.After about 10 minutes have passed begin rolling the mixture into a log starting from the top. Once the rolls have been made, cut the rolls into one inch size logs. Place the cut rolls on a serving platter.Heat oil in a pan for seasoning; add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, curry leaves allow them to crackle.Sprinkle the seasoning over the rolls and garnish with coriander leaves and coconut. This can be made one day ahead and kept in the refrigerator and warmed up in the microwave before serving.Serve Spinach Khandvi as a side dish along with Gujarati Dal, Aloo Bhindi and Hot Phulkas for your weekday lunch."

"Homemade Quick Puff Pastry Sheet Recipe | Perfect For Puffs, Tarts & Pies.","315 grams All Purpose Flour (Maida),5 grams Salt,220 grams Butter (unsalted) - chilled and chopped into 3/4 inch pieces,120 ml Chilled water",200,moderate,Continental,Vegetarian,Diabetic Friendly,"To begin making the Quick Puff Pastry Recipe Sheet for making puffs, measure all the ingredients and keep them ready.Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and give a quick stir to combine it. Add the large cubes of butter into the flour mixture.Ensure each piece of butter is coated fully into flour. When it is coated in flour it will be less likely to melt and also less likely to melt out of the dough later when we roll to make the sheets.This process of covering the butter with flour is called lamination of the butter with flour. If it is not laminated well, the butter will melt out of the dough and you will end up with a puff that is not flaky. Next, squish up the cubes of butter coated with flour by pressing between your fingers.  Like shown in the image below.Once all the pieces are squished, just toss them in flour once again. You need to ensure all the butter pieces are well coated with flour.Make a well in the center and add little ice water at a time. Starting with 1/3 cup and then adding more if required a tablespoon at a time. Because every single brand of flour absorbs moisture differently, we need to ensure we add that water little at a time. To mix the water in, toss the flour into the water and it helps the water get incorporated to form the dough without kneading. Do not knead the dough, as it can activate too much gluten.When it gets to a stage where the puff pastry dough forms large clumps, you can knead a little to understand how much more moisture is needed to bring the dough together without breaking those butter shingles. Add a few tablespoons of water if needed again to bring the dry flour together to form the dough. It is important to get the dough to the right hydration level. If it becomes too wet, then the dough will become sticky and might not be the best thing for puff pastry. Gently press and bring the flour together to form a dough without kneading. It is important to work as quickly as possible. If you take too long and knead too long the heat from your hands will melt the butter and make it sticky. We need to ensure that the butter is still in big pieces in the dough after bringing it together.The dough will look rough and not smooth and you will be able to see the big chunks of butter and will not look totally smooth.Divide the dough in two halves and shape each piece into an almost square disk.Wrap each disc of dough in a plastic/ cling film wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. Based on the warmth and the humidity of the region, a minimum one hour will allow the dough to rest before we begin the folds to make the puff pastry sheet.After one hour, remove the dough from the refrigerator.Dust the working surface with very little flour. Open one of the discs while the other is still in refrigeration. First RoundRoll out the dough into a rough rectangle shape to about 1/2 inch thickness. The dough will be tough, so use a little muscle to roll it out.If you feel the dough is sticky with butter, sprinkle a little bit of flour in the area where the butter feels sticky.  Ensure you dust off any excess flour.Once you have rolled it into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle, fold the dough into half and then fold the half into a quarter again. This is the first fold. We will proceed to make the 2nd fold in the same round.Dust a little flour if required and roll into a 1/2 inch rectangle again and then do the folds (first into half and then again fold the half into a quarter).Wrap this dough the same cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour until the dough is firm.Second RoundAfter an hour, repeat the process mentioned in the first round again. Once you are done with at least 3 to 4 rounds of rolling, folding and chilling process, the puff pastry dough is ready. You need to ensure you refrigerate the puff pastry dough for at least 6 to 8 hours before you are ready to use it to make puffs, tarts and more. These puff pastry sheets can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 to 4 months. When you are ready to use them, thaw for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature and begin using it for the recipes. "
